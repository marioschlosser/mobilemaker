Mixodia is a bright fantasy creature-mixing game where players combine magical creatures to create powerful hybrids, then battle them against increasingly challenging opponents. The game emphasizes strategic creature design, trait inheritance, and tactical combat decisions.

Players start with basic elemental creatures (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) and mix them to create hybrids that inherit traits from both parents. Each battle earns essence and unlocks new traits, allowing for increasingly complex and powerful creature combinations. The goal is to build the ultimate hybrid army and conquer the Arena Masters.

Inspired by creature breeding/fusion games:

Pokemon Infinite Fusion's stat inheritance system (head vs body bias)
The Monster Breeder's gladiatorial combat and trait manipulation
Hybrid Animals' creature combination mechanics
Monster Sanctuary's turn-based tactical creature battles
